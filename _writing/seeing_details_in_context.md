> "History...is not merely something to be read. And it does not refer merely, or even principally, to the past. On the contrary, the great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do. It could scarcely be otherwise, since it is to history that we owe our frames of reference, our identities, and our aspirations. And it is with great pain and terror that one begins to realize this. In great pain and terror one begins to assess the history which has placed one where one is and formed one's point of view. In great pain and terror because, therefore, one enters into battle with that historical creation, Oneself, and attempts to recreate oneself according to a principle more humane and more liberating; one begins the attempt to achieve a level of personal maturity and freedom which robs history of its tyrannical power, and also changes history."

I start with the words of James Baldwin from 1985. I would like to declare our frame of reference wide and look at some of our histories, both personal and collective. I would like to discuss how the stories that we have about ourselves as individuals, groups and whole cultures shape how we see things. This will follow a thread that interests me. I hope you find interest in it too.

# My History

My name is Anna Bambridge and I live in Glasgow, Scotland. My first encounters with eyesight care were when I was 3 years old and taken for visits to the orthoptist and optometrist. I was given glasses which I wore all day every day. As I grew up my glasses got stronger every year until I was very short-sighted with thick glasses. 

I was interested then about what my glasses did. At school when universities and employers came to talk to us about our futures I asked about how to do optics and was told that it was part of physics. This all worked well for me as I loved maths and physics so I carried on and studied them at Cambridge University where I specialised in astronomy. The optics I was using then was that of space telescopes rather than glasses. My own eyesight was still getting worse every year.

One of my favourite parts about physics was how weird and wonderful it would get. We learned Newtonian dynamics with its reductionist paradigm at school but then at university the worlds of quantum dynamics and chaos theory opened up and all the rules were broken and the theory we had learned to rely on at school didn't work any more. The world views we had constructed had to be de-constructed and reimagined again and again with the results of new experiments and the development of new theories. I think this was the biggest learning from my scientific training that along with experimental rigour we need to have flexibility of thought. History was continually being rewritten as new contexts for understanding emerged. The stories we were told about how the world works kept shifting and evolving. 

When I encountered natural eyesight improvement in my twenties and started my personal Bates method work my blur started to clear and I started to feel the progress of relaxation and movement slowly working its way through my being. There were people who thought I was crazy for embarking on this natural eyesight experiment. But I was an experimental scientist, I had to see this for myself. I had experienced paradigm shifts before in terms of ideas but this time it was a bit different. It wasn't just theoretical, it also involved direct experimentation with me, my body and my sensory perception; my very ways of being in the world.

But my questioning scientist self still craved a bit of theory to go with this experiment I was experiencing. I started a research project with the hope of understanding more of what was going on with my own vision and also trying to explain to other people and show them that it is possible to improve eyesight.

That is some of _my_ history but now I turn to Bates Method history and the concept of Central Fixation.

# Bates's Central Fixation Chapter

What is Central Fixation?  As Central Fixation is not a straightforward idea, and because it is Bates's wording and concept I turn for inspiration to his book _The Cure of Imperfect Sight by Treatment Without Glasses_ published in 1920. I will look particularly at the chapter _Central Fixation_ and I offer some of my thoughts on how I understand it. 

First let me declare an interest. I love this chapter, I get excited about it. I have ideas and thoughts and history to share. What I see when I read this chapter is a paradigm shift in process. It's sexy, it's revolutionary! Let me see if I can show you what I mean...

Bates starts the chapter using the mechanical reference points of his time. 

> "The eye is a minature camera." 

But camera metaphors only work in stillness. All the 17th and 18th century knowledge that the understanding of the eye in terms of lenses is based on comes from dissection. Dissection of dead, still eyes which has taught us much. Bates writes in detail about the anatomy of the retina. He relates the current understanding of the retinal structure talking about the importance of the dramatic increase of cell density towards the centre.  And yet...his tone starts to shift and he starts questioning. It is getting interesting. 

Phrases such as _"which is supposed to be"_ and _"...the text books state...but I have never seen such a case..."_ start appearing as Bates documents the problems he sees in the current thinking. He is getting frustrated with the disconnect between the theoretical explanations of his schooling and the observations he is making in real life. Here is the tension and conflict where the edge of scientific creativity lies. 

And it is no wonder there is this disconnect for it was written into the material from the start. In Hermann von Helmholtz's Treatise on Physiological Optics (one of the first texts of modern optometry published in 1867) Helmholtz sets it out from the very beginning. I do not detract from his incredible achievements. But no scientist would ever want their theories to be mistaken for truth and immune from continual questioning and re-evaluating. In his introduction Helmholtz himself says that it is his intention to rid the field of "curious contradictions" and he states-

> "I have proceeded on the conviction that law and order even if they are not fundamentally sound, are better than contradictions and lawlessness."  

Helmholtz is a giant of nineteenth century science. He likes the elegance of the mathematics of optics (so do I, I admire the Treatise for its scope and ambition). But I also like the messiness of life and Helmholtz deliberately and successfully sets out to make a coherent and definite statement on how vision works thus silencing all the competing differences of opinion from his time. And over-riding lots of actual experiences. Helmholtz tells a convincing story mostly in the language of mathematics. It is a story that works. Glasses do generally make people see more of the eye-chart. But as Helmholtz himself admits, _it is a story_. No more or less valid than all the other ways we have of understanding the world.

No wonder Bates was frustrated. But luckily for us he continued his work and went in some way to re-creating understanding. Bates's work can not be understood through dissection or diagrammatic representations of lenses and focussing mechanisms because movement is necessary. And for movement we need life.

But movement alone is still not enough. We also need this presence, attention, mind, consciousness. Attention needs directing it needs someone being interested and seeing. The centrepoint of central fixation is where our attention is. Our attention is very real and yet not physical. We can not touch it with our hands, it is an abstraction and yet we are very aware of what it is and what happens when it fragments.

Here's Bates's interpretation of what is happening when blur arises. He says _"The cause of this loss of function in the centre of sight is mental strain."_
Mental strain! Now Helmholtz never got close to mentioning this stuff, we are on wholly different terrain and need a whole new set of reference points.

There is, now, an explicit departure from the symptom suppression of the allopathic tradition. Bates says _"The discomfort and pain may be absent in the chronic condition, and it is an encouraging symptom when the patient begins to experience them."_ The reappearance of symptoms is seen as encouraging. This for me has echoes of contemporary naturopathic philosophies. We see the loss of direct cause and effect. For symptom _"a"_ we take medicine _"b"_, or do exercise _"c"_ falls away. That's not how this works.

This is where Bates's writing explores what I would call a holistic understanding. He writes

>"Since central fixation is impossible without mental control, central fixation of the eye means central fixation of the mind. It means, therefore, health in all parts of the body...all the vital processes are improved by it  - digestion, assimilation, elimination...The efficacy of the mind is enormously increased." 

He is reporting his experience and conclusion that when eyesight improves there are other health benefits too, it is all connected. And even more telling he also writes that

>"poor sight is a symptom of strain and relieved by __any method__ that relieves strain..."

So this work is holistic and _any method_ can work if it addresses the strain. What relieves strain? Playing sport, a sauna, a good belly laugh, art, a night out dancing. Any of this has the potential to clarify us in body, mind and eyesight, but only if we can participate with dynamic relaxation.

So, coming back to eyesight Bates elaborates one of the fundamentals of his concept of Central Fixation like this..

> "...the nearer the point of maximum vision approaches a _mathematical point which has no area_ the better the eyesight."

Now this takes us far from the mechanical and anatomical theories. A mathematical point is again an abstraction. It is a theoretical idea that doesn't exist in physicality. Yet as an idea it is wholly useful. (For me it is like the abstraction of infinity which is necessary in calculus. Infinity is an imaginative concept and yet it is crucial to engineering which relies on calculus for lots of practical things like constructing buildings and bridges.) 

And then there is something about it that 'clicks'. The vision comes in  'clear flashes' and then stamina with maintaining the flash or getting more clear flashes becomes the process.

The 'clear flash' does not arrive gradually. It is sudden and an instantaneous change of state that can feel as if it has come from nowhere. It seems like the quantum leap of an electron from one level to another in an atom; instantaneous and complete without in-between stages.

This isn't a linear process -there are no one to one relationships. These belong to a different paradigm. The changes aren't necessarily gradual or related to how many exercises we have done. They come in unexpected jumps. The harder we try the more elusive clarity becomes. Which isn't to say we shouldn't practise. We very much need to practise, but our own practise with light, rest, movement, memory and imagination. What works for one - doesn't work for all - there are so many learning activities out there - try them! Someone blind can experience the comfort and clarity of a clear flash although they may still have organic issues preventing the kind of clarity that can read an eye chart. 

Central fixation is Bates's way of describing this point where everything comes together, the vision is clear, we're in the flow, the stars align and we feel at home in ourselves and on our planet, there is connection. Inner and outer merge.  Again quoting from Bates and his pupil experiencing clarity.

> "No words, she said, could adequately describe it. Every nerve seemed to be relaxed and a feeling of comfort and rest permeated her whole body."

But why aren't we here all the time? This can be painful. It can be emotional. Everything in our culture still mostly tells us it isn't possible. These are big blocks.

And tracking Bates's thinking for me, this chapter is so crucial and beautiful because as a scientist this is where we see the shift of paradigm. It starts with a reductionist mechanistic this is how the retina works and it takes in each piece of information one at a time and then that becomes not quite sufficient to describe the things that he is observing and so it opens out into a holistic understanding - he speaks about the full body, the mind, he talks about seeing not just an eyechart but the moons of Jupiter. It gets universal!

# Industrial, Capitalist, Colonising Civilisation

Natural vision teacher Roberto Kaplan in his book Conscious Seeing reflects on eyesight and culture. He refers to Robert Kellum's 1996 dissertation "Capitalism and the Eye" which speaks particularly on short-sightedness. This work uses an analysis centring around the effect of industrial and colonising systems, that is, those that use money. Kellum claims that over the course of the past 700 years there has been a shift in how we view the world, a movement from the outward, clear-sighted view to a decidedly inward-focussed view. I quote,

>"As the viewpoint becomes inward directed toward the 'self' and the body, so near-sighted perceptions appear in the mind. The thinking becomes self-centred...This is the consciousness of near-sightedness,...we lose the perspective of the hunter-gatherer who is clear sighted in the distance. \
This near-sighted way of perceiving began to appear when commerce developed. Prior to this time people were intimately involved with the environment, observing the seasons, and seeing the big picture, that is, their dependence on the animals and plants and the social interactions that maintained a healthy community." 

Here we see an idealised notion of an indigenous culture but the global decline in the past couple of centuries from general clear sightedness to epidemic myopia is undeniable. Kaplan discusses Kellum's ideas and broadens the picture even more.

> "We begin to see, then, how the ways we use our eyes have consequences that extend quite beyond the matter of how clearly we can focus...the use of the eyes literally helping to shape the consciousness of  a society... the width of the picture people saw in their minds began to shrink. The role of spiritual healing as a cultural norm began to be replaced with physics and medicine of the physical realm which are concentrated on a narrower field. The importance of intuition was eclipsed by cognitive reasoning. If an idea couldn't be proven by the new emerging scientific paradigm it was thought to be worthy of little respect or value. Nature, witchcraft and ancient shamanic practices, which epitomised _seeing in its broadest sense_, were deemed primitive and without merit. ...Glasses started to be prescribed to "correct" vision."

And then the money started to get behind glasses and marketing got involved. There is money to be made, make more! I quote again from Kaplan's _"Conscious Seeing"_.

> "In 1936 the Better Vision Institute was formed with the help of frame and lens manufacturers, wholesalers, dispensing opticians and optometrists.\
This organization was to promote how "cool" and conscious it was to wear glasses. The idea was to promote a program of "eye consciousness". Endorsements from celebrities, safety posters, coupled with radio broadcasts, helped the public get over the prejudice of wearing glasses. At the time a book "Be Beautiful in Glasses" was written. As this indoctrination was established the consumer became aligned with the association of the wearing of glasses as being seen as more intellectual."

This is the cultural soup that Bates's work landed in. It didn't really stand a chance for popularity as it requires a change in mindset and there is no physical product to manufacture and sell. 

# Civilised?

In Bates's Central Fixation chapter there is a sentence that I would like to pay particular attention to and it is this...

> "The remarkable vision of savages who can see with the naked eye objects for which most civilised persons require a telescope is a matter of central fixation."

Before I start discussing this I want to share some words from Toni Morrison.

>"There is no such thing as race. None...Scientifically, anthropologically, racism is a construct - a social construct. And it has benefits. Money can be made off of it, and people who don't like themselves can feel better because of it." I just want to make sure that this is clear.

Going back to Bates's words they evoke the idea of the _noble savage_, an idealized concept who symbolizes the innate goodness of one not exposed to the corrupting influence of civilization. This was prevalent in18th & 19th century writings and undoubtedly "in the air" during Bates's time. But I don't want to write off what he is trying to say, and I wonder how much direct experience of different cultures he had? At the time of his birth in 1860 colonisation of the Americas was several centuries in and continuing and slavery was still legal. The concepts of race developed in the late seventeenth century for commercial reasons were fully entrenched. 

I feel an echo from my research notebooks from 1997.

> "I read through the literature about short-sightedness and again and again colonisation comes up. There are lots of studies meticulously measuring and documenting the eyesight of indigenous populations in colonised countries. The premise of these papers is that the situations being studied provide a clean experiment in how the introduction of schooling and reading leads to short-sightedness. However, I can't help thinking that there is so much else being introduced at the same time: violence, cruelty, disempowerment and disconnection from culture, community and nature. None of these are ever mentioned in the scientific studies though. They just document a population with clear eyesight turning into one with chronic difficulties seeing over the course of one generation."

Does colonisation kill central fixation?

Although I like to think that my family is peace loving and progressive, socialist and defenders of freedom and human rights I don't have to dig very deep to find out that my personal historical legacy is deeply one of the coloniser. I am white and British. We have photographs of my paternal grandmother in Egypt as a toddler because her father was in the British army stationed there. My maternal great-grandmother was born in Jamaica because her father was a missionary there. On both sides of my family and on both sides of the Atlantic it is clear what my cultural heritage in this picture is.

Bates, too was white and we presume of European heritage. An American, an English speaker schooled in the modern science of the times which travelled to Turtle Island with the European colonisers. He lived in New York which is on the traditional and ancestral land of Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca nations. These nations were violently colonized by the Dutch, English and French. We are not directly on this land. Vision education rests on the work of Bates and this history is part of his history and context and it is historically unacknowledged. He pays tribute to the good eyesight of indigenous people. Can we also recognise what that means for today's indigenous people, and how we see eyesight in relation to this? For although the project of colonisation has violently caused pain and damage to much land and many people First Nations people are still a contemporary reality. New York City today has one of the largest urban Native American and Indigenous populations in the United States.  Alongside this acknowledgment, however, I share the words of Dr. Eugemoa Zuroski who says.

> "Our acknowledgments will always, necessarily, be inadequate to the task of addressing how deeply and violently colonization has implicated us in one another, to the task of answering fully for what must be repaired." 

# La Minga Indigena

In November 2021 I was walking near my home on the streets of Glasgow and I could smell fire. It smelled smoky and comforting but was unusual for first thing in the morning. Then two men turned the corner in front of me and started walking towards me carrying a bucket between them. The bucket had smoke wafting out of it and I realised what it must be. It was a ceremonial fire being brought from where it was kept alight during the night at a community greenspace back to the Arts Centre grounds where it was tended during the day. This was the fire of La Minga Indigena, a group of 150 delegates from Indigenous groups across the Americas who were in Glasgow for the COP26 climate crisis conference. I had answered the local call out for volunteers and was coming for my first kitchen shift in the church hall the delegates used as their base.

I was quickly directed towards Rossanna, who was managing the kitchen. She asked if I was up for a hug and she scooped me into her warm arms. Immediately with her look, touch and presence I could feel the importance of this. Her sincerity brought tears to my eyes and made me feel connected to something in a way I didn't even realise I was wanting. I was astonished at how much I could suddenly feel. Here was a woman who cared deeply. As the days went by I found out more about La Minga Indigena, Rosanna and her work. It was not just me who felt this way.  Here's some of a piece in a local newspaper written at the time.

> Over 13 days the COP26 summit brought thousands of delegates, activists and some 200 world leaders to Glasgow in the latest international attempt to try and hinder the worsening climate crisis.

> Among them were indigenous delegates from the deepest forests of the Amazon and the highest communities in the Andes, delegates who helped form the largest gathering of Indigenous leaders from the Americas to ever participate at a COP conference.

> One such delegate was Rossana Huenufil, a Mapuche leader and representative from the city of Valparaíso in Chile, who founded the Olla Común La Resistencia soup kitchen to feed families in need in her city.

> Despite having rare full access to all areas at the summit, Rossana could be found heading a team, made up of local volunteers  to cook for her fellow indigenous COP26 delegates and Minga Indígena volunteers. She cooked delicious meals for the group using food that was donated or was being thrown out from supermarkets.

> Rossana explained why she made the decision to spend her time in Glasgow cooking rather than attending the summit.\
"My problem was that I saw so much ostentation in people, so much power, so much waste of money that it hurt me, it pained me to see all that money, money that is not invested in people, in caring for seeds, in improving the lives of many people. 

> "So it disturbed me to be in that place along with people who didn't care, who never looked around them to see if the person next to them was okay, or was feeling well or comfortable. They wanted to come to show themselves off, they don't come here thinking that they need to improve the lives of the world."

> "The next wars are going to be fought over food and water. And that is important. And we are going to kill each other for food. People know it. There will be no food in the supermarket. And that's tough. And people don't see it." 

> “Listening to the voice of the earth is fundamental. Now is the moment to do so."

As part of their presence, and as part of the many international cultural offerings that there were throughout the city along with the COP26 La Minga Indigena presented a show at The Tramway theatre. This was a cultural sharing of poetry, song, dance and medicine. A healer who had grown up in the Ecuadorean forest spoke and shared playfully, musically and earnestly and it resonated with me.  He spoke about needing to look within ourselves, relaxation, memory, imagination, music and dance. All my learning from the Bates Method made sense in this context. He also spoke about how the natural world was sick and needed our attention to care and heal. He and the others with him had travelled such a long way and their message was so simple, so human, and so potent. Were these the "savages" that Bates spoke of? Are these the clear sighted people that so called civilisation destroys, along with clarity? Could we all be like this? The integrity of Rossanna and La Minga was palpable. They were also modern people of course but there was an essence of something important that they were trying to share. Something that us people thoroughly schooled in industrial capitalism's ways of being were missing.  I echo with the visualisations they encouraged, the herbs they shared and the depth of feeling one look or touch inspired. They meant every word they said - intention was crystal clear.

Every care must be taken not to romanticise, appropriate, idealise or exploit. There has already been far too much of that but I am not sure how to avoid it. I am a product of the systems that have done these things and there will always be remnants of it in me, it is my history and there is lots of it I am blind to. But what I heard during that cold November two years ago was a call to a way of being which means collective stewardship rather than individual exploitation. 

Resmaa Menakem in his book My Grandmother's Hands about healing inter-generational individual and collective trauma expresses it like this.

> "...resilience is not a thing or an attribute but a flow. It moves through the body and between multiple bodies when they are harmonized. It is neither built nor developed; it is taken in and expressed as part of  a larger relationship with a family, a group, a community or the world at large."

# Confession

And now I have a confession. I have been chopping things up when I had no right to do so. I stripped the James Baldwin quote that I opened with of its context and exploited it for my own aims of using his thoughts on history. The words that I missed from the start are

> "White man, hear me!" 

His words are not a general musing on the nature of history as I might have implied but a very specific cry from a black man in the United States living with the legacy of slavery. It is an angry plea for change from within and a deeper and broader sense of understanding. It wasn't written to be universal, it was written with specific intent. And although _#notallwhitemen_ they were and are the dominant face of the enduring cultural paradigms of reductionist science, colonising attitudes and exploitation of people and planet. This is now not just about the survival of some indigenous tribes somewhere far away in time and place, it is about the survival of all of us.

Why all this? Why? Because context is crucial and relationships are crucial. This is what the Bates Method shows us and all the things that I have learned about eyesight they need applied out there in the real world here and now.

Have I gone off topic? I don't believe so. These are some of the things that interest me and help to bring me clarity. Why was I and so many others just given glasses as a child and not helped and supported in other ways? That I now see as a destructive act. It's not just putting a sticking plaster on a symptom it is an intervention which has huge physical and perceptual consequences all of which are very poorly understood by those making the interventions. Natural vision teachers' work is often about trying to shed glasses. Awareness about the history of glasses in a social and philosophical context, I believe helps ground the work and give it meaning. It is not just about helping one person to achieve their aim of seeing a bit better. It is so much more than that. If an individual reclaims their own power to see in their own way then their thought processes are freer, their body is less tense, they are more alive, more aware, can feel more intensely, are more connected to and more interested in the world around them. Painful, perhaps, overwhelming, difficult, but the effects ripple out beyond them to family, community and (I sincerely hope) culture.

Do we take on this idea of poor sight being a "civilised" problem (that is only getting worse)? Do we also look to our civilisation to address our collective clarity? If "savages" have good eyesight are we going to give respect and credibility to the cultures and practices that take seriously indigenous rights and reparations?

If vision is not just about an eyeball and if it is about a state of mind and it is relational then as we expand our awareness out from eye to the full body, from personal awareness to relational awareness to community and cultural awareness changing someone's vision becomes part of a much wider tapestry of inter-connected understanding and group resonance.

How do I now see myself in relation to this? Because natural vision improvement is not doing exercises. It is about looking at the world differently and seeing the world differently. That means that you might see things that you didn't expect. It means that you might see things that are uncomfortable. Not everyone will resonate with the analogies that I am making or the journey that I have taken in all these thoughts. You all have your own journeys and your own ways of thinking. But if you want to find a way of seeing that is connected and relevant for people today than contemporary reasons for learning to see need to be there and need to be exciting, and of political and social relevance. Healing on individual, community and global scales. The microscopic and the macroscopic. The tiny detail and the big picture all at once. If your details aren't working zoom out. Does the big picture make sense to you?

I came to see parallels in my own vision journey and the process of de-colonisation. If short-sight is a part of the education system of the industrialised world (and I had fully excelled in achieving in this world and had a large degree of myopia) then part of my healing was necessarily a rejection not only of the glasses themselves but of the thought structures that had given them to me in the first place.

In the field of Optometry Hermann von Helmholtz himself says that his theories are not fundamentally sound. He is often described as one of the _"founding fathers"_ or _"pioneers"_ of the field. Peter Mansfield in his book _The Bates Method_ states that Helmoltz sounds "more like a wild west sheriff than a scientist" in his attempts to tidy up the lawlessness of vision. The phrasing of all this now resonates for me with colonialism. 

Helmholtz's theories are beautiful and self-consistent. He achieved his aim at introducing law and order into the messy business of life and scientific discovery but we are all living with the consequences of this mindset. This confinement over emergence. This knowing better and deliberately ignoring the complications of direct observation for the sake of theoretical clarity. Like introducing fencing to the plains and dividing land into fields. Like constructing race to separate one sort of human from another, creating social inclusion and exclusion. As Helmholtz himself says it is "not fundamentally sound". It is the natural conclusion from the dominant paradigm of then and still now which allows this violent mode of thinking. There is a continued holding on to the idea that dissection and separating into controllable variables is the only way to understand. I believe that the Bates method which is holistic and freeing has always found acceptance difficult because of this.

All this to say that when someone experiences a change and their vision shifts, it's a big thing. The world is different because of this. Their energy is different. Coming for a natural vision lesson in the first place is either a last resort (all the other avenues of help haven't worked) or it is a rejection of a societal norm and an awareness that there is always more than one way to address a problem.

Optometry was still a very young discipline when Bates came to it. It hadn't quite developed itself as separate from Ophthalmology as it is now. It seemed like understanding was up for grabs. But Bates's work was holistic and natural and didn't fit with the reductionist paradigm that was sweeping the continent. It was something that was "felt" and although Bates did his best to explain it to people then and to us now, through his writing, it seems that then, as in now it is always the experience of it that wins people over and if someone is not willing to even give it a go, to undertake the experiment, wholeheartedly for themselves, then it is difficult to shift the understanding. As Bates himself came up against time and time again and which he outlines well in his chapter entitled _"Reason and Authority"_.

# Paradigm Shifts

Science is a process of observation, experimentation and understanding. We weave stories around what we see to make sense of it. There is deep knowledge from other paradigms and cultures that do not follow the protocols of context stripping and individuation we have destructively relied on. There is a need to give genuine intellectual credibility to other ways of knowing. Holistic science, First Nations science, emerging creative protocols are possible. And for me Bates's concept of Central Fixation helps us with this.

# Nothing and Everything. Creativity and Freedom

The level of detail that we are invited to see is a mathematical point. It is not even a full stop, or the tip of a pencil, it is less than this, it is abstract it is smaller than we can understand and moves faster than we can control. This is magic, no? And yet we need to work with it? But how, what is our frame of reference? Well this now is infinite. Again how do we work with this? Our context is 'everything' and our point of reference is 'nothing'. We're working with everything and nothing! What freedom to explore! To create our own meanings and discover what works. Let's come to our senses. Smell, taste, listen, feel, move, see. What brings you clarity? What does this mean for you? Do your own experiments. Free yourself from and transform history.
