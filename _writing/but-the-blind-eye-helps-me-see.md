This is the story of Elaine and the journey that we took together exploring her vision. Elaine first came to see me in January 2010. She was 36, a successful artist and businesswoman with an active social life and she was in a crisis. Here is her story in her words.

# Vision History

> I first got glasses when I was about 5 and I had a severe detached retina when I was about 12. I had surgery. A buckle placed around my eye which didn’t work and a series of operations including my vitreous being removed and replaced with oil. My eye rejected that. There were long recovery periods after the operations. I had severe double vision for quite a long time – it was difficult. My right eye retina did detach completely but I had a few years of seeing shape and light from dark. At 17 or 18 years old I totally lost vision in my right eye.

At age 22 or 23 I noticed spots of flashing and went to the hospital and they said there was a hole in the left retina. A band was put in and again the eye rejected the band (it bulged under eyelid) and it was removed. The retina remained stable with increased episodes of flashing but no detachment.”

What Elaine presented with on that first session was no sight at all in her right eye. With her left eye, she was experiencing some peripheral vision loss, a vitreous veil floater which sometimes obscured her vision and flashing in an area across and to the right of her central vision. She was also wearing a -7D contact lens. That day she saw 20/40 with the lens and 2/200 without it.

The problem that was foremost was not her eyesight, however, it was the intense feelings she had towards her non-seeing right eye. The eye was alive and I couldn’t tell by looking at it that it wasn’t seeing.

> I went through a personal crisis and it felt like my vision had got dramatically worse. The flashing in my left eye was intense and my feelings towards my right eye were incredibly negative to the point were I rejected my right eye because I felt that it was failing and it led me to think that I should have my right eye removed and I went to see a specialist to see if this was possible and they considered doing it. I was in a state of crisis and looking for help.

# Our Work Together

We met for 27 sessions over 2 ½ years and we worked with a standard programme of vision education. What was important throughout was that we gave equal attention to each eye separately and also spent time with them working together.

> One of the most striking moments was when we used an eye patch. We covered the right eye, the one I believed was defunct and wanted to have removed and when it was covered with an eye patch I realised immediately that I didn’t want it to be covered, it felt like it didn’t want to be covered. That was quite a profound moment.

> It became apparent through the work that my right eye is alive and it wasn’t dead and something that should be removed, and it really was a part of me and part of my overall vision. That was huge for me, it was a huge relief to find out that it was alive and that it was working with me and it definitely didn’t want to be removed (laugh). That was a lovely thing to find out and has been very important in terms of my own mental health and acceptance.

Elaine’s vision measured on an eye chart got better when her right eye was included. Her right eye needed to be part of the picture for her to have access to her best sight.

> Working with techniques with eyes separately and together I realised that my right eye really did play a role. My left eye doesn’t see so well when my right eye is covered. What I’ve realised is that my right eye does support the vision in my left eye. And my overall vision is better with both eyes open. The work that we do has helped me reduce the impact that stress has on my vision. What I’ve realised is that stress plays a huge factor in how I see.

> It’s been interesting to see how my vision can change throughout the activities.

 
# Self Work

> I think it’s really important when you are coping with vision loss or eye disease that there is emotional support there and I think that this kind of work (vision education) can offer that. It’s almost like you can provide yourself with emotional support through this work. Some of the language used by consultants can be terrifying (I was told I had a hole in my retina) and there can be a terrible lack of awareness and sensitivity and actually it can be really quite damaging. You have to walk out of the hospital and carry those words with you and work out what they mean. I found I could build those words into something incredibly negative…and then it’s 6-12 months before you see them again.

> There’s responsibility there with this work, you (my vision teacher) provide me with suggestions and tools which I can take on board or not take on board. It might be that I don’t get it immediately but through time and repetition…

> Looking back to when I was in such a state of crisis the work we’ve done has helped balance my feelings towards my vision and my eyes. And I am much more open to the possibilities through the experience of taking part. I have experienced improvements in my vision and in my feeling towards my vision. It’s been a huge support to me, and it’s a support that isn’t available through the eye consultants at the hospital.
