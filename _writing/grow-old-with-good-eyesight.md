Do you really need reading glasses? This is Lorena’s Story.

# Short-sight and presbyopia

Lorena first came to see me in 2007. She was 69 years old and had weak varifocals for mild short sight and mild presbyopia which she rarely wore. During our first session, her vision for reading improved. Soon after this, she went on a holiday which involved a bus trip. She said she remembered looking out of the window and seeing clearly, then remembering she didn’t have her glasses on. This was an important moment for her and she often referred back to it.

Lorena came to see me 2 or 3 times a year. We would check her vision and I would teach, support and encourage her with natural vision practices. She had small vision issues: the start of a cataract in her left eye which never progressed but gave her occasional doubling and shadows, some mild presbyopia which disappeared quickly with a little attention and a small amount of astigmatism.

# Good vision habits

If you dug about there were always things to work with but basically she had good eyesight. Her eyes worked well together and she could drive and read without glasses. She had good vision habits. When I taught her the Bates Method practice of shifting it was natural to her. She described having done it spontaneously as a child. She spoke of enjoying the twilight in her home and not turning the lights on as it got darker. This gave her exposure to a healthy range of lighting conditions.

“I like palming. I like the way I see better after it too. There’s such an obvious change in how much more I can see.”

Lorena Mann, 2014.

# Improved eyesight for reading

This story sounds unremarkable but the numbers are unusual in a society where it is assumed our near vision will deteriorate quickly in middle age. Her near point eyesight improves through her seventies.

Lorena was a dynamic person. In her seventies, she was working and travelling independently. She had a good network of family and friends and she actively chose what she wanted to do with her time.

# Managing vision problems naturally

In 2011 Lorena had a haemorrhage and needed brain surgery. She recovered well from this and got back to working and travelling. Through this and subsequent other health issues, she still came to see me for a vision lesson when she could. We would check her sight and discuss how what was going on was impacting her vision. She had keen awareness, self-knowledge and motivation. The vision issues she had she was able to manage naturally.

In 2016 Lorena passed away. I am glad I was able to attend her funeral to say goodbye and celebrate her with her family and friends. I feel privileged to have known and worked with her.
