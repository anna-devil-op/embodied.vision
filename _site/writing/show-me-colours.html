<p>It is possible to see well throughout life. Here is the story of one woman who did.</p>

<h1 id="clear-vision">Clear vision</h1>

<p>The last time I saw my cousin Peggy, it was the summer. Poppies were growing at the edge of the pavement, and it was hot and dry. She was 89 and lived in a care home in Norfolk. Peggy was a teacher, an artist, a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, and she had really good eyesight her whole life.</p>

<h1 id="reading-small-print-without-glasses">Reading small print without glasses</h1>

<p>In her fifties, Peggy was prescribed glasses as most people are. On her retirement, she moved to the countryside, and one day she noticed that her glasses didn’t make any difference for her and she stopped wearing them and never looked back. When I was with her, she was reading the smallest print in the Radio Times easily. She says she can read medicine bottles too. She doesn’t have a trace of presbyopia. At 89 she said that the optician told her that she had the very beginning of a cataract, but she didn’t notice it. She kept her really good eyesight until she died aged 90. Although her eyes and ears were strong, her legs give her difficulties, and it was because of her lack of mobility that she needed care.</p>

<h1 id="imagination">Imagination</h1>

<p>Her lack of independence meant that she had a lack of privacy and personal space. She used her imagination to help fill this gap. In one of her regular meditations, she would imagine that she entered one of the pictures on her wall and walked along the path in it, enjoying the trees. She liked being the only one who knew what the other side of the trees looked like when she imagined walking back through and out of the picture.</p>

<p>This picture was also special because her late husband, James, painted it. Peggy and James fell in love and married when they were both in their 70s. Like giggling teenagers, they were a delight to be around. They had 10 years of sharing life together, which Peggy described as true happiness.</p>

<p>When I think of Peggy in relation to the Bates Method, I am always struck by how she had excellent mental clarity with a genuine interest in the world around her, a superb memory and an active imagination. All these different aspects of seeing, that Dr Bates spoke much of, were so active in Peggy and her lifelong clear eyesight reflected that.</p>

<h1 id="the-enjoyment-of-seeing">The enjoyment of seeing</h1>

<p>Peggy spent her life relishing her visual sense. Her paintings are vibrant and colourful. She had a cut-glass hanging at her window, which reflected small rainbows throughout her room when the sun shone on it. She spoke with joy of the purity of these colours like she was drinking them.</p>

<p>Peggy passed away in March 2019. Her last request was “Show me colours!”. She was too weak to open her eyes, but her son spoke softly to her of the beautiful greens of leaves, the vibrant reds of flowers and blues of bird wings. He composed a song of these colourful descriptions which he sang at her funeral. It was a fitting tribute conveying the essence of Peggy and her passion, vibrancy and light.</p>
