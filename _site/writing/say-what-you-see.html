<p>What words do you use to describe your eyes and vision? Anna Bambridge explores the importance of the language of seeing.</p>

<h1 id="words-thought-and-meaning">Words thought and meaning.</h1>

<p>The language of eyesight is rich and loaded with meaning—how we speak and the words we choose matter. Words are the building blocks of our language, and our language creates our thoughts, ideas and meaning. These all form our state of mind, and our mind and our vision are inextricably linked. This is an important principle of the Bates Method.</p>

<h1 id="bad-eyes">Bad eyes</h1>

<p>Many people will point to one of their eyes and say, “this is my bad eye” or “this is my lazy eye”. With these words, there is a sense of judgment being put on that eye and a separation from it. What happens if we turn this around a bit? What if we offer the description of this eye, for example, as tired, stressed, strained or struggling. With all of these words, the judgment involved in saying “bad” and “lazy” is removed, and the possibilities for change are immediately present. Tiredness, stress, strain and struggle have the potential of transformation through rest and relaxation.</p>

<p>Glasses or contact lenses are often described as optical correction. The word correction immediately implies that the person’s visual system got it wrong. They are correcting what a person sees. Simply switching this term for compensating lenses or even supporting lenses can have a huge effect on how someone views themselves. They don’t need to be corrected, but they may need a bit of support, for now, in the form of glasses or contact lenses to help them with visual difficulty.</p>

<h1 id="i-cant-see-anything">“I can’t see anything.”</h1>

<p>Sometimes people come for a vision lesson saying “I can’t see anything”. Rarely does this mean that they are actually blind. In fact, it usually has very little to do with the level of their eyesight difficulty. What is often the case is that they have a little bit of blur that they find disconcerting. Finding a way to accurately describe visual sensations and the way someone experiences them can give insights into the nature of their difficulties.</p>

<h1 id="brighter-colours-when-in-love">Brighter colours when in love</h1>

<p>There is the often reported sensation of colours being more intense when someone is in love. The experience of the visual vibrancy of the flowers and the moon is used to describe the state of mind accompanying the experience. Many a love song is a testament to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>People’s relationship with their eyesight, especially when they are experiencing visual changes, can be fraught and fragile. Subtle shifts in vocabulary can have profound consequences for how someone feels about their eyesight and themselves. It can change how they see things.</p>

<h1 id="bates-method-as-metaphor">Bates Method as Metaphor</h1>

<p>The metaphor of the visual vocabulary goes on and gets deeper. How colourful is what you see? Do you have a sense of perspective? Do you experience depth? Can you see the point? All of these are valid questions when learning about the nature of someone’s eyesight, but they all mean so much more. Do you see?</p>
