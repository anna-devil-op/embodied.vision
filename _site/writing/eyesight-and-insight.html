Join her on her sometimes difficult, often surprising and ultimately delightful healing journey from ‘fuzz’ to focus.</em></p>

<h1 id="a-child-with-glasses">A Child With Glasses</h1>
<p>I was first given glasses at the age of three and I wore them during my childhood and adolescence. Throughout these years each time I returned to the optician I received a stronger pair of glasses until, at 20 years old, I was very short-sighted and completely reliant on glasses or contact lenses. To give you an indication of how little I could see, if there was an eye-chart on the wall I wouldn’t have known it was there. Reading any of the letters on it would have been unthinkable. They were simply invisible to me in the blur that I had without glasses. When I was 22 I met an optometrist who set me on the journey of visual discovery that I am still on. He told me my glasses were too strong, made them weaker and taught me relaxation and visual training techniques. Before this time my vision had only ever got worse but within two weeks of practising the techniques I started noticing improvements in my eyesight. I became fascinated with the process and learned all that I could about how to improve vision naturally. I learned the Bates Method of vision education, different kinds of movement and bodywork and I learned about nutrition and emotional release techniques. All of this helped to improve my vision but more than this, the changes just felt right. I could feel myself unlocking and releasing and I loved the relaxation of it. It all became about much more than my eyesight in ways I could never have predicted. Teaching my eyes to see became the path for my journey in discovery of my own vision in a much wider sense than just eyesight.</p>

<h1 id="living-with-blur">Living With Blur</h1>
<p>I reduced the strength of my glasses slowly for a few years and then there came a time when I took the plunge and decided not to wear glasses at all. I had seen that healing was possible and that my vision was improving in small steps, so why not go all the way? This decision coincided with my father’s death. It was a time of great sadness for me but also a time of great change. I wanted to fully experience my natural vision — which was still very blurry. Living with blur meant lots of things were different for me. I could not rush around or chase after things anymore, I simply could not see well enough to do things quickly. The blur forced me to slow right down and deal with what came to me. I was vulnerable and my life became much more inward facing for a while. I had to learn how to ask for help and my life took on a meditative quality. As I lost the ability to see too far ahead, living in the present was all I could do. All of these things, although not always easy, were precious life lessons. Slowly, slowly my blur started to clear and I learned how to see more and more. Sometimes I would have flashes of completely clear vision and over time these became longer and stronger. These times of clarity were always unexpected and came with insight as well with outer sight.</p>

<h1 id="the-transformational-power-of-acceptance">The Transformational Power of Acceptance</h1>
<p>I remember one day I was in my kitchen and I was looking around and trying to see but all I could see was everything I couldn’t see and I was getting really
annoyed by it. I had been doing lots of exercises and practising lots of eyesight techniques. and felt that I was achieving nothing. I still couldn’t see any better. I couldn’t see anything clearly and the kitchen was a fog of unformed shapes and dull colours. Aaaargh! I gave up. It was all too much effort. I sat down and I looked around honestly and I thought to myself, clearly, ‘I see so much blur’. The kitchen instantly transformed into a solid room of bright colours and sharp edges. I could visually see clearly! I laughed. My clear thoughts and acknowledgement of the truth of the situation cleared up my blurry eyesight.</p>

<h1 id="support-is-vital">Support is Vital</h1>
<p>I discovered that it was not only inner thoughts that were important when changing my vision but also the surrounding opinions of others. While I was doing a lot of practical work on myself I was studying eyesight difficulties from every perspective I could find and doing a lot of reading and writing on the subject. One day I was sitting at my desk and I was writing a review of the conventional textbooks. I was writing about short-sightedness and blur and about how glasses are necessary and how poor sight is inevitable and about how once someone wears glasses they will have to for the rest of their life. As I wrote the summary of these opinions the text book pages blurred, the letters faded. I hunched in closer and closer to the paper and the computer and I was having great difficulty in seeing clearly. Later on the same day I changed topics and moved to reviewing some other books, ones which speak about the possibilities of healing vision and give practical examples and stories of change and success. As I was writing this part the page in front of me was dazzlingly clear. The letters stood out proud and black against the white page. I sat up straight and I could see clearly. My clear vision was so new and so unsteady then that even reading about how what I was doing was impossible made it impossible and reading about how eyesight could improve reinforced my own experience and helped me see clearly.</p>

<h1 id="taking-responsibility">Taking Responsibility</h1>
<p>Acceptance and positive reinforcement were important in healing my vision but so also was taking responsibility for myself and my actions. This is illustrated most dramatically by an experience with my vision that I had when I was shopping with my mother. The shop we were in was the same one we had come to for years and it had been the scene of many arguments in the past. We were shopping for clothes. I didn’t like it. I was whining and whingeing. I was annoyed about being in the shop. I was annoyed about wandering around. I was seeing with blur. I was following my mother without any intentions. I didn’t want to shop, I didn’t know why I was there. We were building to a fight. I almost left and went home as I had done many times before and then I was completely struck by something. A realisation if you like. A realisation that I was not a child. A realisation that my mum was having a hard time shopping. A realisation that I could choose to be there or not. An understanding that my role, at that moment, was to give to my mother, to help. All of this came instantaneously and with it an extraordinary clearing of my vision. The shop and everything in it suddenly became crystal clear. I could see the colours and the edges of all the clothes and signs and people far and near. It stayed like this for the afternoon while we bought what we needed and walked home together.</p>

<h1 id="gratitude-and-joy">Gratitude and Joy</h1>
<p>Times like these with dramatic changes in my vision didn’t happen very often but when they did I was always filled with a sense of awe. Now, as seeing with clarity happens more frequently and for longer periods of time, it is becoming more normal but it still feels very different to seeing through glasses or seeing blur. When I see clearly it is like being full of what I see. It is almost like being what I see to the point where I disappear. And in a way the me that I knew (the one who sees blur) does disappear and this can be so unfamiliar that it is scary. The feeling of seeing clearly naturally, however, goes beyond these fears and is exhilarating, stimulating and joyous. It feels to me like being a part of all life. From the day I started working with my eyesight it has continued improving. I am enormously grateful to my vision, to the blur, the distortions and also to the clarity. My vision is still unstable although much, much more clear (I can now see if there is a chart on the wall and can usually read about three-quarters of the way down it, sometimes less, sometimes more). I am looking forward to the next stages on the journey that looking with my natural eyes will take me. Glasses, contact lenses and laser eye surgery are useful interventions which compensate for and can support struggling eyes. If used constantly, however, I now believe that they reinforce patterns of tension and strain and hide the innate potential each of us has for healing our own inner and outer vision.</p>
