<p>Why practise the Bates Method? Why explore your blurred vision? Because it has the potential to change your perceptions of everything.</p>

<h1 id="taking-off-your-glasses">Taking off your glasses</h1>

<p>As a natural vision teacher when someone comes to me it is usually because there is something about their eyesight that they are looking for help with. Often this involves someone who wears glasses some or all of the time. When someone like this comes to me, after some introductions, one of the first things that I will ask them to do is to take off their glasses (or contact lenses).</p>

<p>For me, this is always a defining moment. The quality in the room changes and I feel that I am now meeting the person I will be working with. There are other times when someone has little or no obvious eyesight disturbance or for whom there is a visual challenge but no glasses to take off, e.g. visual pathologies. In these situations guiding someone to an awareness of their natural vision is a less direct process but is, in essence, the same.</p>

<h1 id="vulnerability-and-connection">Vulnerability and connection</h1>

<p>What happens when someone starts to experience their natural vision goes to the very heart of why Vision Education is worthwhile. To help explain this I turn to Brené Brown and her 2010 TED talk “The Power of Vulnerability”. The way she describes her research about vulnerability and connection resonates strongly with my experience of vision work.</p>

<p>Her starting place is that connection is what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. From her research she found that the only thing keeping us out of connection is the fear that we are not worthy of it. We have a shame that we are not enough; not good enough, fast enough, thin enough etc., etc. And this shame is a fear of disconnection that comes with excruciating vulnerability.</p>

<h1 id="numbed-sensations">Numbed sensations</h1>

<p>When these difficult emotions are too painful they are numbed. Numbed by addiction or medication or perfecting or by trying to make the uncertain certain. If we are numb to our vulnerability then we have toned down our sensations of shame and fear and our struggles to feel a sense of worth. But emotions cannot be selectively numbed and if you turn down the grief and the fear and the pain and you stop feeling vulnerable you lose something. Vulnerability is also the birthplace of joy, creativity, belonging and love.</p>

<p>She describes the people she saw in her research who had a strong sense of connection as being the people who saw vulnerability as necessary but not excruciating. In order for connection to happen we need to let ourselves be really seen. We need to be willing to be who we are and not who we think we should be. Connection is the result of authenticity, of having the courage to be imperfect.</p>

<p>If someone comes to me who has been wearing glasses for a long time and then they take them off and spend time in their natural vision I am usually struck by their vulnerability. Where there was certainty there is now uncertainty. Where they were in control they are now tentative. And crucially where I see struggles they are now usually more available to receive support. There is a stronger ability to connect. While I instinctively enjoy this space I am grateful to Brené Brown’s work for articulating so well why it is crucial.</p>

<h1 id="creative-change">Creative change</h1>

<p>The vulnerability can be there because of the new experience of blur or because the blur is clearing or because someone is seeing in a way that is unfamiliar to them but it is always an access point for creative change.</p>

<p>Sometimes people ask – why should I work with my natural vision? Why should I go through all the discomfort of experiencing my blur, or exploring the places I can’t see? Why shouldn’t I just get a stronger prescription in my glasses?</p>

<p>And Brown articulates it beautifully. It is about learning how to stop numbing ourselves. It is about letting ourselves be seen, blur and all. It’s about asking for help when we need it. It is being able to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart and to believe that “I am enough”.</p>

<p>It is a vulnerable world and there are no guarantees. If you choose to explore your natural vision it might change nothing, or one thing, or everything. This work is about expanding perceptions. Vision work involves taking a step of courage into the vulnerability of imperfections, unknowns and possibilities.</p>
