                <h3>Eyesight</h3>
                <p>
                    Eyesight is a learned process which depends on internal reflexes and external stimuli.
                    It depends on a weaving of inner and outer experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eyesight needs the electromagnetic energy of light from the sun and physical, mental,
                    emotional, social and spiritual awareness. A dynamic relating of all these elements permeates
                    healthy vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Embodied Vision Bates Method Practitioner Programme we explore and engage with all
                    these aspects of vision through supported experiential study.

                <h3>5 day in-person modules</h3>
                <p>
                    Each module will weave in the essential elements of light, rest, movement, memory and
                    imagination. Through practical sessions students will work with each other and as a group to
                    learn how to teach Bates Method Vision Education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The modules also provide
                <ul>
                    <li>a supportive space to explore your own eyesight</li>
                    <li>professional awareness of vision and Vision Education practices</li>
                    <li>clinical experience</li>
                    <li>in-person experience for teachers who have learned online</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The modules can be taken separately but also layer together, in any order, to form a complete
                    professional training with over 200 hours of contact time. Students who successfully complete
                    all six modules and the homework requirements will become certified Bates Vision Education
                    teachers.

                    a different theme. Here is a taste of some of the topics covered in each module.
