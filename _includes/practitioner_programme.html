                <h3>Eyesight</h3>
                <p>
                    Eyesight is a learned process which depends on internal reflexes and external stimuli.
                    It depends on a weaving of inner and outer experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eyesight needs the electromagnetic energy of light from the sun and physical, mental,
                    emotional, social and spiritual awareness. A dynamic relating of all these elements permeates
                    healthy vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Embodied Vision Bates Method Practitioner Programme we explore and engage with all
                    these aspects of vision through supported experiential study.

                <h3>5 day in-person modules</h3>
                <p>
                    Each module will weave in the essential elements of light, rest, movement, memory and
                    imagination. Through practical sessions students will work with each other and as a group to
                    learn how to teach Bates Method Vision Education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The modules also provide
                <ul>
                    <li>a supportive space to explore your own eyesight</li>
                    <li>professional awareness of vision and Vision Education practices</li>
                    <li>clinical experience</li>
                    <li>in-person experience for teachers who have learned online</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The modules can be taken separately but also layer together, in any order, to form a complete
                    professional training with over 200 hours of contact time. Students who successfully complete
                    all six modules and the homework requirements will become certified Bates Vision Education
                    teachers.

                <p>
                    Daniela wore glasses for nearly twenty years. When she was on
                    maternity leave with her first child she discarded the glasses and
                    after some time she realized that her eyesight improved
                    spontaneously. So, she found out that vision can improve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her second child was born prematurely and as a result suffers
                    from cerebral palsy and is visually impaired. Daniela looked for
                    any possibilities to help him and she found the Bates Method. She studied in London and
                    graduated from the Bates College of Vision Education in 2013.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2014, she started her own business in BanskÃ¡ Bystrica, Slovakia. Daniela continues
                    educating herself in the field of natural vision improvement and has attended workshops
                    with Meir Schneider, Fernanda Leite Ribeiro, Mikolaj Markiewicz, Dror Schneider and
                    many others. She has over 3000 hours in-person one to one teaching experience as well
                    as having taught many group workshops and talks including one at the International
                    Holistic Vision Conference in Edinburgh in 2017. She has been a guest on podcasts in

                    "I grew up on a Farm in Co Cork, Ireland, where I enjoyed the outdoor life. I have been
                    interested in eyesight since my early teens when I was prescribed my first glasses. I
                    disliked wearing them but felt I had no choice when my sight was blurry for the school
                    board.

                    I discovered the Bates Method through a book written by Peter Mansfield. I had always
                    been interested in natural health and was fascinated that sight could improve. My vision
                    story was that I experienced short-sight. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of exploration in
                    learning the Bates Method. I loved looking at the world in new ways and learning what
                    helped my vision.

                <p>
                    Iâm passionate about empowering and educating people about other possibilities regarding
                    their health â in particular Eyecare and Vision."

                    "I am passionate about using my experience and knowledge to
                    support people in discovering and nurturing their natural vision. I
                    have worked with many clients over the years and it always brings
                    me joy to share in their journey of self-discovery and clarity.

                    I first began wearing glasses at the age of 18, after leaving school and starting work. Prior
                    to this, I had enjoyed perfect eyesight. After 20 years of lenses/glasses, my eyesight had
                    steadily been deteriorating and my prescription escalated to +6.5 dioptres. It was at this
                    point that I decided to look into the possibility of improving my vision by natural methods. I
                    read âBetter Eyesight Without Glassesâ by W. H. Bates. Though difficult to understand, I
                    followed the instructions written in the book and began to notice improvements in my
                    vision. I was thrilled as I had never thought this was possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time I learned to make friends with the blur if it presented itself. I realised that the blur
                    alerted me when I needed to take a more relaxed approach towards seeing rather than
                    fighting and trying to force better vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am so grateful that I began this vision journey. I have learned so much about how the
                    way I choose to see the world affects my vision."
