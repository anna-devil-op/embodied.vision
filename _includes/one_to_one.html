                    Everyone experiences some variation in their vision throughout life. From slight blurring when ill to severe visual challenges and blindness. Understanding the flexibility of your vision and learning what makes it as clear as possible is a valuable life skill.

                    One to one sessions allow you to fully explore vision education in a way that is just for you. Using principles and activities rooted in the Bates Method of Vision Education I can guide you to discover different aspects of your eyesight and what might affect your experience of seeing. These sessions are always responsive to your needs and evolve as you learn and grow in confidence with the work.

                        What I’ve realised is that stress plays a huge factor in how I see. It’s been interesting to see how my vision can change throughout the practises.

                        I’ve experienced profound changes in my perception of the world, visually of course, but also in so many other ways. The work goes deep and has touched all parts of my self. Anna’s playful way with the sessions is great – fun and always supportive through this remarkable process.
