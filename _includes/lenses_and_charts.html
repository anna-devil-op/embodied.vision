                    This training is aimed at natural vision teachers but is open to anyone who is interested. It has come about from me wanting to share my learnings from physics and optometry with the natural vision community.

                    An individual's eyesight is unique to them and also changeable. Our work as vision teachers is predominantly supporting a whole person process. However, we also encounter chart measurements and refractive lens prescriptions and understanding the numbers of optometry is useful in our work. Numbers are often what students arrive with, they give us information, they are part of the picture in vision education.
