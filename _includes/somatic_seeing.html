                    Please join me in my explorations teaching embodied vision education online. These classes are relaxing and perception enhancing, helping you to move into your vision. My aim is that they will feel meditative. The classes will involve some stillness and some gentle movement. Each week we explore a different visual theme, for example, colour, context, texture, depth, details...

                        It is a time/space for relaxing, coming into my body, slowing down, and vision is one of the vehicles for this - a sort of body/mind meditation.

                        There is something about the simplicity and gentleness of your work that is deeply moving.  I can’t imagine that it’s just me that ended the class with a feeling of having been taken deep inside to the centre of their being, and wanting to just stay quietly there.
