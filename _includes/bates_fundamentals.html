                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Bates Method is many things. At its heart is simplicity: the more relaxed we are the more we can see. It is a way to access our own perceptual capacity and can be used in a very practical way for natural eyesight care, as part of a creative process or as a spiritual practice. In this workshop we will cover the fundamental elements of the Bates Method. We will visit the topics of light, rest, movement, memory and imagination and learn how they relate to the philosophy and practice of this deep and powerful method.                </p>
                <p>
                    The workshop will consist of presentations, discussion and experiential participation.
